# ‚úÖ FM-LLM-Solver Enhanced User System - Quick Start Checklist

**Follow this checklist to deploy your enhanced FM-LLM-Solver with complete user account management and certificate generation tracking.**

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ‚òê 1. Server Requirements
- [ ] Linux server (Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS/RHEL) with sudo access
- [ ] At least 4GB RAM, 20GB disk space
- [ ] Internet connectivity for downloads and SSL certificates
- [ ] Domain name pointing to your server (for production SSL)

### ‚òê 2. Install Prerequisites
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
    docker.io docker-compose \
    postgresql-client \
    nginx certbot \
    curl wget git python3

# Start Docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in for Docker group to take effect
```

### ‚òê 3. Prepare Information
Have these ready for the deployment script:
- [ ] **Domain name** (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
- [ ] **Admin email address** for SSL certificates
- [ ] **SMTP settings** for user notifications:
  - SMTP host (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
  - SMTP username (your email)
  - SMTP password (app password)

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### ‚òê 4. Clone Repository and Navigate
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> fm-llm-solver
cd fm-llm-solver
```

### ‚òê 5. Verify Files Present
```bash
# Check core files exist
ls -la sql/init.sql
ls -la docker-compose.hybrid.yml
ls -la scripts/quick-deploy.sh
ls -la web_interface/models.py
```

### ‚òê 6. Run Automated Deployment
```bash
./scripts/quick-deploy.sh
```

**The script will prompt you for:**
- Domain name
- Admin email
- SMTP settings
- Monitoring preference (y/n)

**It will automatically:**
- Generate secure passwords and keys
- Set up SSL certificates
- Initialize database with enhanced schema
- Deploy Docker containers
- Create management scripts
- Run health checks

### ‚òê 7. Verify Deployment Success
```bash
# Check all services running
./scripts/manage.sh status

# Should show:
# ‚úÖ Web service: HEALTHY
# ‚úÖ Database: HEALTHY  
# ‚úÖ Redis: HEALTHY
# ‚úÖ User account system: HEALTHY
```

## üéØ Post-Deployment Verification

### ‚òê 8. Test Web Interface
- [ ] Visit `https://yourdomain.com` - should load the main page
- [ ] Visit `https://yourdomain.com/auth/register` - should show registration form
- [ ] Visit `https://yourdomain.com/auth/login` - should show login form

### ‚òê 9. Create and Test User Account
- [ ] Register a new user account
- [ ] Log in successfully
- [ ] Access profile page at `/auth/profile`
- [ ] Verify profile has 6 tabs: Overview, Profile, Usage, History, API, Settings

### ‚òê 10. Test Certificate Generation Tracking ‚≠ê (Main Feature)
- [ ] Generate a certificate through the web interface
- [ ] Check user's profile ‚Üí Certificate History tab
- [ ] Verify the certificate appears with:
  - User attribution (linked to your account)
  - Generation timestamp
  - System details
  - Model configuration used
- [ ] **This confirms certificate generation tracking is working!**

### ‚òê 11. Test Admin Functionality
- [ ] Create admin user with `./scripts/create-admin.sh`
- [ ] Log in as admin
- [ ] Access Admin Panel tab in profile
- [ ] Verify can see all users and their activity

### ‚òê 12. Verify Database Schema
```bash
# Check enhanced database tables exist
docker exec fm-llm-solver-postgres-1 psql -U fm_user -d fm_llm_solver -c "
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename IN ('users', 'user_activities', 'query_logs', 'certificate_favorites')
ORDER BY tablename;
"
```

## üîß Management and Maintenance

### ‚òê 13. Learn Management Commands
```bash
./scripts/manage.sh start      # Start all services
./scripts/manage.sh stop       # Stop all services
./scripts/manage.sh restart    # Restart services
./scripts/manage.sh status     # Check health
./scripts/manage.sh logs       # View logs
```

### ‚òê 14. Set Up Automated Backups
- [ ] Verify backup script exists: `ls -la scripts/backup-db.sh`
- [ ] Test manual backup: `./scripts/backup-db.sh`
- [ ] Check cron job was created: `crontab -l`

### ‚òê 15. Security Configuration (Optional but Recommended)
- [ ] Configure firewall (only allow ports 22, 80, 443)
- [ ] Set up fail2ban for SSH protection
- [ ] Configure log rotation
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

## üéâ Success Criteria

**Your deployment is successful when:**

‚úÖ **Web interface is accessible** via HTTPS  
‚úÖ **Users can register and log in**  
‚úÖ **Certificate generation creates tracked entries** ‚≠ê  
‚úÖ **User profiles show certificate history** ‚≠ê  
‚úÖ **Admin panel shows all user activity** ‚≠ê  
‚úÖ **All health checks pass**  
‚úÖ **Database contains enhanced user data**  

## üÜò Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### If Web Interface Won't Load:
```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps

# Check web service logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs web

# Restart web service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml restart web
```

### If Database Issues:
```bash
# Test database connection
docker exec fm-llm-solver-postgres-1 pg_isready -U fm_user

# Check database logs
docker logs fm-llm-solver-postgres-1

# Restart database
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml restart postgres
```

### If SSL Certificate Issues:
```bash
# Check certificate validity
openssl x509 -in ssl/fullchain.pem -text -noout

# Renew Let's Encrypt certificate
sudo certbot renew

# Restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
