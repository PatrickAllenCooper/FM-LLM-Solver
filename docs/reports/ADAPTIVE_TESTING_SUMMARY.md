# Adaptive Testing System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented an intelligent adaptive testing system for FM-LLM Solver that automatically detects the testing environment and adjusts the testing strategy accordingly.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Environment Detection Module (`fm_llm_solver/core/environment_detector.py`)
- **Comprehensive hardware detection**: CPU cores, memory, GPU capabilities (CUDA/MPS)
- **Environment type classification**: MacBook, desktop, or deployed
- **Cloud platform detection**: AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD systems
- **Performance characteristics assessment**: Memory constraints, parallel processing capabilities

### 2. Adaptive Test Runner (`tests/adaptive_test_runner.py`)
- **Environment-aware test selection**: Different test categories based on environment
- **Resource optimization**: Memory limits, parallel job counts, timeout multipliers
- **Test scope management**: Essential, comprehensive, or production scopes
- **Category-based testing**: Modular test categories that can be included/excluded

### 3. Main Test Entry Point (`test_runner.py`)
- **Simple command-line interface**: Easy access to adaptive testing features
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintains support for legacy test runner
- **Environment information**: Built-in environment detection reporting
- **Flexible configuration**: Support for overrides and custom scenarios

### 4. Enhanced Legacy Test Runner (`tests/run_tests.py`)
- **Adaptive integration**: Uses adaptive testing by default
- **Graceful fallback**: Falls back to legacy mode when adaptive testing unavailable
- **Compatibility preservation**: All existing functionality maintained

## Environment-Specific Optimizations

### MacBook Environment
- **Conservative resource usage**: 30% memory limit, 4 parallel jobs max
- **Thermal management**: 2-3x timeout multipliers to account for throttling

### Desktop Environment  
- **Aggressive resource usage**: 50% memory limit, up to 8 parallel jobs
- **GPU acceleration**: Full CUDA support when available
- **Comprehensive scope**: Complete test suite including performance tests
- **Optimal performance**: Baseline timeouts with hardware acceleration

### Deployed Environment
- **Production-safe settings**: 20% memory limit, 2 parallel jobs max
