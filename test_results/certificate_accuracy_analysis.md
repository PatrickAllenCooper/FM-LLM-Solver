# Certificate Accuracy Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

**Current Overall Accuracy: 64.4%** ❌

The system shows **significant accuracy issues** that need immediate attention:

- **Extraction Accuracy**: 60% (3/5 correct)
- **Validation Accuracy**: 58.3% (7/12 correct) 
- **End-to-End Accuracy**: 75% (3/4 correct)

## Detailed Issues Analysis

### 1. Certificate Extraction Problems

#### Issue 1: Decimal Precision Loss
- **Problem**: `B(x,y) = x**2 + y**2 - 1.5` → extracted as `x**2 + y**2 - 1`
- **Impact**: Critical mathematical errors
- **Root Cause**: Regex pattern not handling decimal numbers properly

#### Issue 2: Template Detection Failure
- **Problem**: `ax**2 + by**2 + c` should be rejected as template but isn't
- **Impact**: Invalid certificates pass through
- **Root Cause**: Template detection logic too permissive

### 2. Mathematical Validation Problems

#### Issue 1: Over-Permissive Validation
- **Problem**: Certificates that should be invalid are being accepted
- **Examples**: 
  - `x**2 + y**2 - 0.5` for stable system (too small barrier)
  - `x**2 + y**2 - 5.0` for stable system (too large barrier)
- **Root Cause**: Validation logic not properly checking barrier conditions

#### Issue 2: 3D System Validation Failure
- **Problem**: 3D certificates failing validation completely
- **Symptom**: Empty Lie derivative calculations
- **Root Cause**: 3D dynamics parsing issues

#### Issue 3: Incomplete Barrier Condition Checking
- **Problem**: Not properly testing all barrier conditions
- **Missing**: Proper boundary condition verification
- **Root Cause**: Simplified test point sampling

### 3. System-Specific Issues

#### Linear Stable 2D System (50% accuracy)
- ✅ Correctly validates valid certificates
- ❌ Fails to reject invalid certificates (too small/large barriers)

#### Linear Unstable 2D System (100% accuracy)
- ✅ Correctly rejects all certificates (as expected for unstable system)

#### Nonlinear Cubic 2D System (67% accuracy)
- ✅ Correctly validates valid certificates
- ❌ Fails to reject one invalid certificate

#### Linear 3D System (33% accuracy)
- ❌ Complete validation failure
- ❌ Empty Lie derivative calculations

## Critical Failures

### 1. Mathematical Correctness
The validation logic is **not mathematically rigorous enough**. It should:
- Check barrier conditions at boundary points
- Verify Lie derivative conditions throughout the domain
- Validate separation between initial and unsafe sets

### 2. Extraction Reliability
The extraction is **not reliable** for:
- Decimal numbers in certificates
- Template detection
- Complex mathematical expressions

### 3. System Coverage
The system **fails completely** on:
- 3D systems
- Complex nonlinear dynamics
- Multi-variable certificates

## Improvement Recommendations

   - Implement fallback extraction methods

## Success Criteria

To achieve **near-perfect accuracy**, the system must:

1. **Extraction Accuracy ≥ 95%**
   - Correctly extract all valid certificates
   - Properly reject all templates
   - Handle decimal numbers accurately

2. **Validation Accuracy ≥ 95%**
   - Correctly validate all mathematically sound certificates
   - Properly reject all invalid certificates
   - Handle all system types (2D, 3D, nonlinear)

3. **End-to-End Accuracy ≥ 95%**
   - Complete pipeline accuracy
   - Robust error handling
   - Consistent results across all test cases

## Current Status: ❌ NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

The system requires **significant improvements** before it can be considered reliable for certificate generation and validation.

**Estimated effort to reach 95% accuracy: 2-3 weeks of focused development**
